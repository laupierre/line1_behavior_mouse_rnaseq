# LINE1 behavior mouse RNA-Seq (210825_A00558_0141_AH232YDMXY)

This is the analysis of the in-vivo mouse experiment (food restriction).
The FR group is food restricted, the ST group is the short-term group and the OR group is the over-restricted group.  

The raw counts were obtained with the IIT RNA-Seq pipeline (see github RNA-Seq_mouse repository).  
The rnaseq_mouse_v0.0.2.sh was used for the RNA-Seq analysis.
